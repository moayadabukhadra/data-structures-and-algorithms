# Singly Linked List

*this is an Implementation for a Singly Linked List in python*

## Big O Complexity For Operations On Singly Linked List:

| Operation Names | Big O |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| insert | O(1) |
| includes | O(N) |
| str | O(N) |

-  ## class Node : 

has properties for the "value" stored in the Node, and a pointer to the "next" Node.

- ## class Linked_List:
includes a head property

methodes: 
1. insert : takes a value as argument , Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

2. includes:  takes a value as argument ,Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

3. *__str__*: 
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
